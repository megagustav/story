    Organic food is rising and but with our busy lives, more and more parents are simply buying ready-made baby food in glass jars. These glasses are heated in food warmers and then thrown out. A healthier alternative is preparing fresh food for your baby, which is very time consuming and you will lose food by processing it in its many steps: cutting, steaming, pureeing â€” up to 30%!<br><br>
    Using existing resources, we provide parents with a patent-pending all-in-one solution that allows them to easily prepare fresh food for their baby.
