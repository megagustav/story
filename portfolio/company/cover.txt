Dear Mike,
<br/><br/>
My name is Gustav Moorhouse and I am a multidisciplinary designer, passionate about good work. For me, good work means pride in project ownership for everybody involved and a passion for pushing until the end. We are designers because we want to leave the world a better place than we found it. I see it as our responsibility. <br/><br/>

I'm intrigued how emerging technologies help create a deep connection between the object and its user. I want to explore the interplay of our senses with the things we interact with daily. <br/><br/>

I have more than a decade experience using Adobe apps and web programming and have always enjoyed finding new ways of showing a project in its best light, be it a model, a photo or a render. I believe that a designer nowadays should not only know how to make things and how things are made, but also how to present their work appropriately. <br/><br/>

I enjoy the research side of the Design Process as much as prototyping but am now longing to spend more time down the esoteric rabbit hole of a specific aspect of a product. I spent five years in academia where I was taught fact-based decision making. In later jobs, I've learned to make decisions based on gut feelings rather than concrete data. I would love to go more in-depth and do user testing, with a more analytical and research-driven Design Process. <br/><br/>

This is why I believe that we're a good match. I have a passion for understanding people's needs and discovering their motivations, I am always inspired by new challenges, new beginnings and unfamiliarity, and am very much looking forward to hearing from you. <br/><br/>

Best regards, <br/>
Gustav
